# KC_House predictions

I use linear regression to analyze house prices in northwestern countries

#Business problem -A stakeholder requires to guide home sellers on how to make the houses more valuable.

#Business Question - What can home sellers do to improve house value

## REQUIREMENTS

Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling. This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.
Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process. Refer to the Data Science Process lessonLinks to an external site.
